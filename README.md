Wait what?! The cow I was leading for 10,000 blocks had its lead broken?!?!?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Why is there no sound for when a lead breaks??? There really should be one.

## Features

- Adds a sound for when the lead gets snapped while leading mobs along.
- Configurable volume and pitch

### Planned

- Configurable sound effect to be used

## Usage

Just install and BAM, it works.

### Configuration

Currently there are only two options, `pitch`, and `volume`. Which controll the pitch and volume of the effect.

```
pitch=1.25
volume=1.0
```
